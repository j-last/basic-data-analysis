The purpose of this project was to start applying my programming knowledge to some real-world applications.

The project consisted of finding a way to analyse data from the apple store to identify gaps in the market for new apps. To do this I 

Loosely followed a project guide to tell me what my data analysis should do, which I then implemented.
(https://www.dataquest.io/projects/guided-project-a-profitable-app-profiles-for-the-app-store-and-google-play-markets-2/)

I learnt about one way of comparing data using frequency tables to identify common genres and popularity of different genres. This allows you to compare and see which apps have high popularity, but not as many apps to support that popularity.
To only analyse the free english apps I had to cleanse the dataset to only include these apps, which wasn't as straightforward as it sounds as there wasn't a 'country' or 'language' column in the csv file.

Conclusion:
I was analysing just the free english apps. I discovered that whilst 'games' are most popular, there is a near identical avaliability to popularity correlation, whereas genres such as social networking have higher popularity but don't have as many apps to support this popularity.
