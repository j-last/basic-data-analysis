A project to analyse data from the apple store to identify gaps in the market for new apps.

Loosely followed a project guide to tell me what functions to create, which I then programmed myself.
(https://www.dataquest.io/projects/guided-project-a-profitable-app-profiles-for-the-app-store-and-google-play-markets-2/)

I learnt about one way of comparing data using frequency tables to identify common genres and popularity of different genres.

This allows you to compare the two and identify any regions where there is lots of popularity behind a genre, but not as many apps avaliable in this genre category.

For my case, I was analysing free english apps (which required me to clean the dataset to get only this data). I discovered that whilst 'games' are most popular, there is 
a near identical avaliability <-> popularity correlation, whereas genres such as social networking have higher popularity but don't have as many apps to support this popularity.
